          Exercism aims to provide opportunity for people of 
          %strong all backgrounds 
          by helping them develop their programming skills through practice and mentorship. We provide thousands of exercises spread across over 50 language tracks, and offer both 
          %strong automated and human mentoring.
        %p Our current platform is targeted at people with some programming experience who want to deepen their knowledge or learn new languages. In time, we will also offer support for total beginners.
        %p
          Exercism is
          %strong 100% free.
          It is entirely
          %strong open source
          and relies on the contributions of
          %strong thousands of volunteers.

          .copy Exercism is a great gift to the programming community and I hope when I finally achieve my Rock Star status I won’t forget to give back and do my own bit of mentoring.

        %p Exercism relies on both the generosity of individuals with their time, and the generosity of organisations to financially support us. 
        %p While much of Exercism is run by our volunteer community, the website and core infrastructure are managed by a full-time team. We also undertake specific larger projects, such as the development of our automated analyzers, which require a committed team working more intensely on something over a fixed period of time. 
        %p In order to fund this core team and these products we rely on grant funding from companies or organisation that wish to contribute to our vision of helping providing free programming education for everyone.
